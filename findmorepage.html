     <h2>Selective Eating Disorder</h2>
  
    <h3>What is a Selective Eating Disorder?</h3>

    <p>A selective eating disorder is subsumed under the Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID). Those suffering from ARFID are phobic and anxious about certain foods, have sensory aversions to certain textures, tastes, or swallowing, and often have a restricted diet.</p>

    <h3>How do I know If I have a Selective Eating Disorder?</h3>

    <p>Selective eating disorders affect adults and children alike. Anxiety, depression, and social impairment are symptoms that accompany a selective eating disorder. People who selectively eat only consider those they deem acceptable or safe, avoiding food with a particular color, texture, or taste. Some people cannot even bear to touch certain foods or dread them. Or, the thought of a certain food may lead to panic attacks.</p>

    <p>Selective eaters have an aversion to an entire food group such as vegetables, pulses, or fruits. Those with a selective eating disorder are stressed to try different foods due to the fear of vomiting or choking. Most selective eaters do not have weight issues. They are usually within the normal BMI range.</p>

    <h3>Causes of Selective Eating Disorder</h3>

    <p>A selective eating disorder can be caused by trauma. It may be brought on by even a little unpleasant experience with a particular food, or choking on food, or worse, having witnessed someone choking. If the brain associates specific food with danger, it will protect the body by stimulating anxiety whenever there is contact with it. Selective eating is a way in which people are trying to exert control over their lives.</p>

    <h3>Coping</h3>
    <p>Taking care of mental and physical health goes a long way in helping those with selective eating disorders. Additionally, support from a therapist, a common group, family, or a friend can help along the path to recovery.</p> 

    <p>Beyond self-care, it helps to identify healthy distractions that can be turned to when people find themselves unnecessarily obsessing about weight or food or have the urge to experience disordered eating behavior. Here are a few healthy distractions to consider:</p>

    <ul>Invest in an adult coloring book</ul>
    <ul>Explore a new hobby, such as knitting, painting, or photography</ul>
    <ul>Try a yoga class or DVD</ul>
    <ul>Practice mindfulness meditation</ul>
    <ul>Write in a journal</ul>
    <ul>Take a leisurely walk</ul>

    <h2>Night Eating Syndrome</h2>

    <h3>What is NES?</h3>
    <p>Night eating syndrome (NES) is an eating disorder that occurs along with interrupted sleep (insomnia). NES causes people to wake up during the night to eat, usually several times throughout the night. Untreated, NES makes it difficult to maintain a healthy weight. It also increases the risk of health problems like diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>

    <h3>How do I know If I have a Night Eating Syndrome?</h3>
    <p>If you have NES, you may feel like you won’t be able to fall asleep if you don’t eat. You might feel as if you have no control over your urge to eat in the middle of the night. Many people with NES also have depression or anxiety that is often worse at night.</p>

    <h3>What causes NES?</h3>
    <p>Healthcare providers don’t know exactly what causes NES. They believe it results from several factors, including:</p>

    <ul>Circadian rhythm disorders: The circadian rhythm is the body’s natural “clock” that controls when you feel tired, alert and hungry. If you have NES, your internal clock doesn’t work like it should. Your body releases hormones that make you feel hungry and alert at night rather than during the day.</ul>

    <ul>Genes: NES can run in families, so providers think genes may play a role in who gets the disorder.
Mental health: Many people with NES also have mood disorders such as depression and anxiety.</ul>

    <ul>Other disorders: People with NES are more likely to have other eating disorders and substance abuse disorders. They’re also more likely to have obesity. But the connection between these disorders and NES isn’t clear.</ul>

    <ul>Daytime dieting: NES can sometimes result from not getting enough calories during the day. People who restrict their food intake during the day may be more likely to binge at night.</ul>

    <h3>Coping</h3>
    <p>To help people with NES, healthcare providers usually recommend a combination of treatments. These include antidepressant medications, cognitive behavioral therapy and techniques to correct the sleeping and eating cycle.</p>

    <h2>Binge Eating Disorder</h2>

    <h3>What is Binge Eating Disorder?</h3>

    <p>Binge-eating disorder is a serious eating disorder in which you frequently consume unusually large amounts of food and feel unable to stop eating. Almost everyone overeats on occasion, such as having seconds or thirds of a holiday meal. But for some people, excessive overeating that feels out of control and becomes a regular occurrence crosses the line to binge-eating disorder.</p>

    <h3>What are the Symptoms of Binge Eating Disorder?</h3>
    <p>Most people with binge-eating disorder are overweight or obese, but you may be at a normal weight. Behavioral and emotional signs and symptoms of binge-eating disorder include:</p>
    
    <ul>Eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as over a two-hour period</ul>
    <ul>Feeling that your eating behavior is out of control</ul>
    <ul>Eating even when you're full or not hungry</ul>
    <ul>Eating rapidly during binge episodes</ul>
    <ul>Eating until you're uncomfortably full</ul>
    <ul>Frequently eating alone or in secret</ul>
    <ul>Feeling depressed, disgusted, ashamed, guilty or upset about your eating</ul>
    <ul>Frequently dieting, possibly without weight loss</ul>

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>The causes of binge-eating disorder are unknown. But genetics, biological factors, long-term dieting and psychological issues increase your risk.</p>

    <h3>Treatments</h3>

    <p>Your doctor may refer you to a team of doctors, nutritionists, and therapists who will work to help you get better. Treatment plans may include one or more of the following:</p>

    <ul>Psychotherapy. Sometimes called "talk therapy," psychotherapy is counseling to help you change any harmful thoughts or behaviors. This therapy may focus on the importance of talking about your feelings and how they affect what you do. For example, you might talk about how stress triggers a binge. You may work one-on-one with a therapist or in a group with others who have binge eating disorder.</ul>

    <ul>Nutritional counseling. A registered dietitian can help you eat in a healthier way.
Medicine, such as appetite suppressants or antidepressants prescribed by a doctor. Antidepressants may help some girls and women with binge eating disorder who also have anxiety or depression.
Most girls and women do get better with treatment and are able to eat in healthy ways again. Some may get better after the first treatment. Others get well but may relapse and need treatment again.</ul>

    <h2>Pica</h2>
    <h3>What Is Pica?</h3>
    <p>Pica is an eating disorder in which a person eats things not usually considered food. Young kids often put non-food items (like grass or toys) in their mouths because they're curious about the world around them. But kids with pica (PIE-kuh) go beyond that. Sometimes they eat things that can lead to health problems.</p>

    <h3>What Are the Signs & Symptoms of Pica?</h3>

    <p>People with pica crave and eat non-food items such as:</p>

    <ul>dirt</ul>
    <ul>clay</ul>
    <ul>rocks</ul>
    <ul>paper</ul>
    <ul>ice</ul>
    <ul>crayons</ul>
    <ul>hair</ul>
    <ul>paint chips</ul>
    <ul>chalk</ul>

    <h3>What Causes Pica?</h3>
    <p>Doctors don't know exactly what causes pica. But it's more common in people with:</p>

    <ul>developmental problems, such as autism or intellectual disabilities</ul>
    <ul>mental health problems, like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or schizophrenia</ul>
    <ul>malnutrition or hunger. Non-food items might help give a feeling of fullness. Low levels of nutrients like iron or zinc might trigger specific cravings.</ul>
    <ul>stress. Pica is often seen in kids living in poverty, or in those who've been abused or neglected.</ul>
    <p>Most cases of pica happen in young children and pregnant women. It's normal for kids up to 2 years old to put things in their mouth. So the behavior isn't usually considered a disorder unless a child is older than 2.</p>

    <h3>How Is Pica Treated?</h3>
    <p>Doctors can help parents manage and stop pica-related behaviors. For example, they can work with parents on ways to prevent kids from getting the non-food things they eat. They may recommend childproof locks and high shelving to keep items out of reach.</p>

    <p>Some kids with pica need help from a psychologist or other mental health professional. If these treatments do not work, doctors can also prescribe medicines.</p>
